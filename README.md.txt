##Project Overview

You will install Python using an Anaconda distribution, which comes with IPython notebook, as well many popular Python packages for data analysis, science, math, and engineering. Some of these packages can be difficult to install otherwise, so we highly recommend installing Anaconda. Next, you will get acquainted with an IPython notebook, responding to questions and running code.

It is not required to submit this project or to meet specifications on it, although you are welcome to resubmit until you meet specifications if you like. The project also has no deadline, but we recommend trying to complete it in the first 7 days in the program. This will let you take full advantage of an early opportunity to experience the submission process and receive feedback immediately after you put your newest skills into practice. We also highly encourage you to reach out to your study team for help and to share your work!
